# Seattle Airbnb Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Seattle Airbnb dataset, exploring various factors that contribute to successful Airbnb listings in Seattle. The analysis follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, consisting of six key phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.

## Business Understanding
Opening an Airbnb listing in Seattle comes with several considerations, such as determining the optimal pricing strategy, understanding the impact of amenities on guest satisfaction, and identifying competitive pricing within the neighborhood.

## Data Understanding
The Seattle Airbnb dataset, obtained from publicly accessible sources like Inside Airbnb and Kaggle, provides valuable insights into the Seattle Airbnb market. It includes information about listings, pricing, availability, amenities, and neighborhood details.

## Data Preparation
The data is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure its suitability for analysis. Missing values and irrelevant columns are handled appropriately, and categorical variables are transformed as needed. Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.

## Modeling
Two different modeling techniques, linear regression and XGBoost, are employed to predict listing prices. The models consider factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, room type, and additional amenities to determine their impact on the listing price.

## Evaluation
The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared score. The results indicate the features that have the most significant influence on the price prediction.

## Deployment
The insights gained from the analysis can guide individuals in opening their own Airbnb listings in Seattle. Recommendations include pricing the listings within the $100-$200 range, adjusting prices during the holiday season, providing essential amenities like Wi-Fi and a kitchen, and staying competitive within the neighborhood.
